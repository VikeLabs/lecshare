This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Ensure that you have node(and npm) installed before proceeding with the rest of setup. Typing npm into console will confirm your installation.

run `npm install` in the root directory of the project (the one with package.json and package-lock.json). This will create a folder `node_modules` which will house our dependencies. When pulling new code from repo, remember to npm install to check for any requirements that you don't have.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Workflow

If involved with the team on this project follow the instructions to create new branches and push your work for review. 

### `git branch -b <feature-name>`

From your most up to date branch of master or dlv (`git branch` to check your current branch) type the above command to create a new branch then switch to it. Then, start making any changes you want! Add and commit your files, then...

### `git push lecshare-main <branch-name>` 

This command will create a new branch on the lecshare-main repo and push your local copy to it. Now it's on the repo for review! 

This style of work will isolate feature additions into seperate copies of the code.
